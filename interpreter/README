To compile:

ocamlyacc parser.mly
ocamllex lexer.mll
ocamlc -c types.mli parser.mli lexer.ml parser.ml types.ml driver.ml
ocamlc -o lang lexer.cmo parser.cmo types.cmo driver.cmo
./lang

You can use it interactively as above. Or you can write a "program" in any file, then run it as input to the interpreter by:

./lang < sample_input.txt

It is worth it to write some sample programs as you go by and load them that way, for quick testing of your lexer and parser.


To run the interpreter tests:

ocamlc -c types.mli parser.mli lexer.ml parser.ml types.ml driver.ml
Start utop
Enter: #load "types.cmo";;
Enter: #use "tests.ml";;
