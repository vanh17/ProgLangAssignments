   You should write your functions in this file.
   All your functions should have their parameter types specified.
   Write your code right below the corresponding comment describing the
   function you are asked to write.
*)


(*
   Write a function `getnth` that takes as input a pair of an integer n and a list
   of strings. It then returns the nth element in the list, counting from 1. If
   the list does not have n elements, it should raise an exception (Failure "getnth").
*)



(*
   Write a function `lookup` that takes as input a pair of a string s and a list
   consisting of pairs of a string and an integer. It then goes through the list
   looking for a string that equals s, and if it finds one returns "Some i" where
   i is the corresponding integer in the pair. If it does not find a suitable
   pair then it returns "None".
   It should have type: int * (string * int) list -> int option
*)




(*
   Write a function `inPairs` that takes a list of integers and returns a list
   of pairs of integers as follows: Starting from the head of the list, it puts
   together the next two integers in a pair and keeps going. If the list has an
   odd number of elements then the last element is left out. Example:
   inPairs [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] = [(1, 2); (3, 4)]
   It should have type: int list -> (int * int) list
*)




(*
   Write a function `flatten` that takes as input a list of lists of integers
   and "flattens it out", returning a single list of integers which is the result
   of concatenating all the lists. Example:
   flatten [[1; 2; 3]; []; [4; 5]; [6]] = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
   It should have type: int list list -> int list
*)



(*
   Write a function `removeDups` that takes a list of integers and returns a
   list of the integers in the same order where any later occurence of an integer
   after its first occurence is removed. For example:
   removeDups [4; 1; 2; 1; 4; 5; 20] = [4; 1; 2; 5; 20]
   It should have type: int list -> int list
*)




(*
   Write a function `collateSome` that takes as input a list of option integers
   and returns a list of integers. The list should consist of those integers that
   were part of a `Some v` in the list, and in the same order. For example:
   collateSome [Some 1; None; Some 2; Some 1; None; Some 3] = [1; 2; 1; 3]
   It should have type: int option list -> int list
*)




(*
   Write a function `unzip2` that takes as input a list of pairs of integers
   and returns a pair of lists of integers, formed by unpacking the pairs in the
   original list. For example:
   unzip2 [(1, 2); (3, 4); (5, 6)] = ([1; 3; 5], [2; 4; 6])
   It should have type: (int * int) list -> int list * int list
*)




(*
   Write a function `makeChange` that takes as input a pair of an integer `n` and a
   list of distinct integers assumed to be in decreasing order. It should return
   an option type as follows: If there is a way to use the provided integers so that
   they add up to n, then it should return "Some lst" where lst is the list of the
   used integers, using the larger integers as much as possible. If there is no way
   it should return "None". Examples:
   makeChange (20, [8; 3; 2]) = Some [8; 8; 2; 2]
   makeChange (20, [8; 3]) = Some [8; 3; 3; 3; 3]
   makeChange (20, [13; 11]) = None
   Note that it tries to use the largest integers as much as possible. Make sure to
   write some good tests of this behavior.
   It should have type: int * int list -> int list option
*)
